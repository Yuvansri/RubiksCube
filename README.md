Rubik’s Cube Solver 
  Developed a virtual 3×3 Rubik’s Cube in C++ using three distinct class-based models and standard data structures.
    Utilized Korf’s IDA* algorithm along with BFS, DFS, and IDDFS for optimal and non-optimal cube solving approaches.
    Designing and implementing efficient move execution, cube state representation, and heuristic-based search strategies for accurate and interactive cube solving.
